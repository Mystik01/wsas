As an open source project we rely mainly on volunteers to contribute to the project. If you'd like to help out see the project's page on  GitLab. Non-exhaustively we need the help of programmers, designers and writers.

The project is tracked on our [GitLab repo]({{ site.gitlab }}). If you'd like to help out get in touch on there or contact [{{ site.email }}]](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

We also have a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/kHaiFQH8/xsacdb-product-roadmap) tracking feature additions.
