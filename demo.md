There are two demo instances:

[current.xsacdb.wjdp.uk](https://current.xsacdb.wjdp.uk) — always runs the latest released version. Should be on parity or just a little ahead of club instances.

[next.xsacdb.wjdp.uk](https://next.xsacdb.wjdp.uk) — is constantly deployed to by the integration branch. It's running the next version to be released.

Both instances databases are completely reset and filled with random data (seeded) on every deployment. Current is deployed with every release so goes days+ without resets, next is deployed with every code change to the main development branch so can reset manytimes+ per day. When the instance resets you will be logged out.

## Usernames and passwords

The same pattern applies for the following: od1, od2, sd1, sd2, dl1, dl2, owi1.
