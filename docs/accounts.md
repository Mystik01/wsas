# Accounts

## Registration
xSACdb currently supports two methods of registration, **Facebook** and plain
email address and password. To register with either access the database and
click on either the Facebook or 'Register' button.

## Change Password
You can change your password by selecting `Account Details` using the account
menu. This is the last menu on the navigation bar and is indicated by the user
icon (<i class="fa fa-user"></i>) and your name.

## Connecting and Disconnecting Social Login
Again under `Account Details` on the account menu you'll find `Social Accounts`. You can connect and disconnect social logins from your account here. You may only disconnect all social logins if you have a password set.

## Restricted Changes
Your name can only be changed by a database officer, for more information see
[requesting changes](/help/update-requests).

## Logging out
Select `Logout of Database` from the user menu. This will not affect your
Facebook login state.

## Closing your account
To close your account make a request to a database officer, for more
information see [requesting changes](/help/update-requests).
