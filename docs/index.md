# xSACdb Documentation

This BSAC club database is an instance of the xSACdb software package.
Documentation regarding its use can be found here.

The docs are split into user, officer and administrator sections. The user
section is of relevance to members of the club without any roles on the site.
The officer section deals with the admin side of the software, such as editing
member records and setting up training sessions.

The administrator documentation contains information regarding the installation
and maintenance of the xSACdb software.
